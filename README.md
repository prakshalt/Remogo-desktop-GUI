# Remogo-desktop-GUI
A python GUI program for sending messages to Remogo android application. This program requires an internet connection.
It would require your way2sms credentials.
NOTE:- This program sends SMS using way2sms by creating packets similar to how a user would send a SMS through website.This approach may
not work in future if way2sms changes the way sms are sent by their website. You can use any other sms service by changing the sendsms function
accordingly.You can also use their API services.
